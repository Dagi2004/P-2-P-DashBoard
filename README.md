**P2P Transaction Dashboard**

**Overview**

The P2P Transaction Dashboard is a web application designed to help users track and manage peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. It provides a user-friendly interface to view, add, and filter transactions by status (e.g., Pending, Completed, Failed). The dashboard is built using modern web technologies, including React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

**Features**
- View Transactions: Display a list of all P2P transactions in a table format.

- Add Transactions: Create new transactions using a modal form.

- Filter by Status: Easily filter transactions by their status (Pending, Completed, Failed).

- Responsive Design: The dashboard is fully responsive and works seamlessly on all devices.

- Real-Time Updates: Transactions are dynamically added to the table without requiring a page refresh.

- Detailed View: Click on a transaction to view its details (e.g., sender, receiver, amount, status, and timestamp).

**Technologies Used**

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript for better code quality and maintainability.

- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.

- React Router: For handling navigation and routing within the app.

**State Management**:

React Hooks (useState): For managing component-level state.

**Other Tools**:

- Vite: A fast build tool for modern web development.

- ESLint & Prettier: For code linting and formatting.
